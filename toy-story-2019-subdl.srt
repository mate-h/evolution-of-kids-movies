1
00:00:57,015 --> 00:01:00,394
It's raining cats
and dogs out there!

2
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,104
I hope they make it back
all right.

3
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,356
Heads up! Andy's coming!

4
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,026
Andy, time for dinner.

5
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,528
Yes! I'm starving!

6
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,612
Don't forget to wash your hands!

7
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:11,697
Okay, Mom!

8
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,578
- Do you see him?
- No.

9
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:18,912
Well, he's done for.

10
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,163
He'll be lost! Forever!

11
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,999
Jessie. Buzz. Slink.
Molly's room.

12
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,293
The rest of you, stay put.

13
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:45,647
Bo!

14
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:46,898
Situation?

15
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:48,984
Lost toy. Side yard.

16
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,361
Billy. Goat. Gruff.
Raise the blinds.

17
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,448
They have names?
You never told me that.

18
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,532
You never asked.

19
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,492
Where is he?

20
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,162
There!

21
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,246
How do we reach him?

22
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,748
Operation Pull-Toy!

23
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,374
- Slink!
- You got it, Woody!

24
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,001
Barbies!

25
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,635
Go!

26
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:21,975
Flashlight.

27
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,117
Hang on, R.C.!

28
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:51,046
I ain't got any more slink!

29
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,876
It's beautiful.

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,961
I'm so glad to see

31
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,421
this old lamp go to a good home.

32
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,089
We've had it since
Molly was a baby.

33
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,008
Molly, are you sure
it's all right?

34
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,427
Yeah, I don't want it anymore.

35
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,886
Thank you.

36
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:47,936
Where's Woody?

37
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,321
Yeah, hi.
I think I left my keys here.

38
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,116
- Woody.
- Quick!

39
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,868
We'll sneak in the hedges
before he's back.

40
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,870
Woody, it's okay.

41
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,122
What? No! No, no, no.
You can't go!

42
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,331
What's best for Andy is that...

43
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,499
Woody.

44
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,334
I'm not Andy's toy.

45
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,670
What?

46
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,630
It's time for the next kid.

47
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,382
And thank you again
for everything.

48
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:18,550
I really appreciate it.

49
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,969
My pleasure.
I'm glad it all worked out.

50
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:26,266
You know, kids lose
their toys every day.

51
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,978
Sometimes they get
left in the yard...

52
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,939
or put in the wrong box.

53
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,114
And that box gets taken away.

54
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,415
Mom, where's Woody?

55
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,167
Andy! Come inside!

56
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,251
I can't find Woody!

57
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:15,774
Well, good night.

58
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,692
Goodbye.
Drive safe.

59
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:39,589
There you are.

60
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,675
Mom, I found him! I found him!

61
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,511
Good.
Come on and get inside.

62
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,535
You've got a friend in me

63
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,787
Reach for the sky!

64
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,456
You've got a friend in me

65
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,960
Ride 'em, cowboy! Yee-haw!

66
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,712
When the road looks rough ahead

67
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,463
There's a snake in my boot.

68
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,382
And you're miles and miles
From your nice warm bed

69
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,678
You just remember
what your old pal said

70
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,847
Boy, you've got a friend in me

71
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,348
To infinity and beyond!

72
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,311
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

73
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,272
My cowboy!

74
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,983
Now, some other folks might be
a little bit smarter than I am

75
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,359
Big and stronger, too

76
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,028
Woody, let's go!

77
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,195
Maybe

78
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,364
But none of them will ever
love you the way I do

79
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:48,199
You're my favorite deputy!

80
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,412
It's me and you, boy

81
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,956
And as the years go by

82
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,208
Our friendship will never die

83
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,210
Reach for the sky!

84
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,047
You're gonna see
it's our destiny

85
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,633
They've escaped and they're
headed right for us!

86
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,011
You've got a friend in me

87
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:12,432
- Full speed ahead!
- You've got a friend in me

88
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,394
You've got a friend in me

89
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,616
It's getting hot in here!

90
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:30,700
Where's my ear?

91
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,785
You're on my foot!

92
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,869
Hey, quit shoving.

93
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:33,954
- Sorry!
- Could you move over

94
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,288
- a bit, please?
- That was my horn.

95
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,832
To infinity and beyond!

96
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:38,959
I know that was you,
Potato Head.

97
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,878
Everyone, listen.
I thought I told you...

98
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,964
when Mom quickly cleans
the bedroom like that...

99
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,799
expect to be put in the closet.

100
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,592
How much longer?

101
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,094
Keep it to a dull roar, Rex.

102
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,887
Deep breaths, Jessie.
Deep breaths.

103
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,389
Settle down, Slink.

104
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,682
Sit. Good boy!

105
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,933
Sheriff,
do I need to be worried?

106
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,851
No, no. My guys are veterans.
They'll hang in there.

107
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:59,020
Good. Just keep them calm
until we get word.

108
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,188
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,318
How are you feeling about today?

110
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,779
Good, good. Yeah, good.

111
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,030
I'm good.

112
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,657
Good.

113
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,786
We're on!
Bonnie's done with breakfast!

114
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,329
- Any minute now.
- You hear that?

115
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:17,580
Any minute now.

116
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:18,748
Wind 'em if you got 'em.

117
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,792
Keep your batteries clean,
your joints unlocked...

118
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,960
Thanks, Woody.
I got it.

119
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,295
Yes, I'm sorry.
You're right, you're right.

120
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,008
The town is open!

121
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:29,092
Hi, Mayor!

122
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,176
Banker!

123
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,845
Hi, Ice-Cream Man!
Hi, Hat Shop Owner!

124
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,346
Mailman!

125
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,015
And the sheriff!

126
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,684
Okay. Bye, toys!

127
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,644
Yee-haw! Sheriff Jessie!

128
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,479
Giddy-up, Bullseye!

129
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,695
They went that way!

130
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,988
Chase them!

131
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,827
What a beautiful hat shop!
You have so many hats...

132
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,495
They're doing "hat shop."

133
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:58,747
When's the last time

134
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,873
we ever got to play that?

135
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,416
Remember when
she played "house"?

136
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,500
I liked "house."

137
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,793
Those were the days.

138
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,336
It was basic.
You made a house,

139
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,421
you lived in it, done.

140
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:08,173
That's the third time

141
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,507
you haven't been picked
this week.

142
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:10,967
I don't know.
I don't keep count.

143
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:12,761
You don't have to.

144
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,721
- I'll do it for you.
- Okay, okay, okay, I get it.

145
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:15,889
It's been a while.

146
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,516
Looky there.
You got your first dust bunny.

147
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,685
How adorable.

148
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:21,895
What you gonna name it?

149
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,063
What about Dusty?

150
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,230
- Francis!
- Harry!

151
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,356
- Karen!
- Fuzzball!

152
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,524
- LeBron?
- No, Fluffy.

153
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,109
- How about Thumper?
- Tumbleweed!

154
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,861
"Tumbleweed."
That's good. That's good.

155
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,945
He's a cowboy,

156
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,113
so that makes a lot of sense.

157
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,907
So many choices.

158
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,283
I just can't decide!

159
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,367
Bonnie?

160
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,702
What are you doing?
We gotta go.

161
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:38,787
You don't wanna be late

162
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,080
for kindergarten orientation,
do you?

163
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,373
But I don't wanna go.

164
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:43,875
We talked about this.

165
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,210
We're gonna meet your teachers,

166
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,128
- see your classroom...
- Can I bring a toy?

167
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,048
Toys don't go to school,
that's the rule.

168
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:55,428
Freeze! Nobody move!

169
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,805
Bonnie always forgets something.

170
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,223
She'll be back any second.

171
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,599
That goes for you, too, Hamm.

172
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,767
But it's money!

173
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:02,644
You all right, Woody?

174
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,812
I'm sure she'll pick you
next time.

175
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,897
Come on, I'm fine.
No problem.

176
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,148
Hey, Woody. Here.

177
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,316
Thanks, Jessie.

178
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,110
We're here for you, buddy.

179
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,861
I don't want to play the baker.

180
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:12,946
Pricklepants.

181
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,073
The hat shop owner is
the role I was born to play!

182
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,699
All right, Pricklepants,
back to your bakery.

183
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:17,784
Excuse me, Dolly?

184
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,244
Woody, can't you see
I'm threatening everyone?

185
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,328
Go back to the closet.

186
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,412
Yeah, I know, I know.
It's just...

187
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:22,664
I'm worried about Bonnie.

188
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:24,541
A toy should go with her
to orientation.

189
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,668
Didn't you hear Dad?
You'll get Bonnie in trouble.

190
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,503
Yeah, but kindergarten
is so different.

191
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,213
It can be too much for a kid.

192
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,548
Having a buddy with them
to get through it

193
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,632
can really help things.

194
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,342
I remember with Andy, I would
go to school with him...

195
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,468
I'm sorry, Woody,

196
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:36,678
I hate to sound
like a broken record...

197
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,138
but Bonnie's not Andy.

198
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,681
No, no, no, of course,
I get that.

199
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,974
But if you would just...

200
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,600
Places, everyone!

201
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,532
Bonnie?

202
00:10:58,241 --> 00:10:59,826
What are you doing back there?

203
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,078
Come on, we have to go.

204
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,874
That's my big girl.

205
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:08,459
Come on. We gotta hurry, okay?

206
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,254
Don't forget your backpack.

207
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:14,007
You're gonna have so much fun.

208
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,553
All right. Now what was it
you were saying, Woody?

209
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,889
Woody?

210
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,064
Here we are.

211
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,833
Bonnie, honey, it'll be okay.

212
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,085
Hi! Are you Bonnie?

213
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,378
My name is Miss Wendy.

214
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,963
I'm going to be
your kindergarten teacher.

215
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,093
We have a special place where
you can put your backpack.

216
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,095
You want to see?

217
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,992
Here we are, Bonnie.
Just for you.

218
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,578
Okay, class, let's all find
a seat at a table...

219
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:27,956
so we can start craft time.

220
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,374
On the first day of school,

221
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,501
you'll need a place
to put your pencils.

222
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,879
So, today, we're going
to make pencil holders.

223
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,340
Now, everyone take a cup...

224
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,593
and we'll use the art supplies
to decorate them.

225
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,263
Hi.

226
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,685
Bonnie. That is so clever.

227
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,813
"Hello, I'm Forky.
Nice to meet you!"

228
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,690
Well, hello, Forky,
it's nice to meet you.

229
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,192
I'm Miss Wendy.

230
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,113
Mom! Dad!
Look what I made!

231
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,531
His name is Forky!

232
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:27,033
That is so cool!

233
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,868
I finished kindergarten!

234
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,830
No.
That was just orientation.

235
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,415
But for being such a brave girl,

236
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:35,750
we have a surprise for you.

237
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,834
What is it?

238
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,002
Since school doesn't start

239
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:40,546
for another week,
we are going on a road trip!

240
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,548
- Can I bring Forky?
- 'Course you can!

241
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,058
And they said I shouldn't
go to school with Bonnie.

242
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,061
We got this kindergarten thing
under control?

243
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,064
I can't believe
I'm talking to a spork.

244
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,574
Hi, toys!
Bye, toys!

245
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,124
He did go to kindergarten!

246
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,542
- I knew it.
- No, no, no, guys, listen...

247
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,626
You tryin' to get
Bonnie in trouble?

248
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:19,836
No, of course not!

249
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,003
You could have been confiscated.

250
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,964
- What does that mean?
- Taken away.

251
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,215
- No!
- Or worse.

252
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,299
You could've been lost!

253
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,467
No, no, no, guys, listen.

254
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,177
Bonnie had a great day
in class...

255
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,554
and we're going on a road trip.

256
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,013
- Road trip?
- Vacation!

257
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,265
Yee-haw!

258
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,058
But then something
really weird happened.

259
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:35,810
Bonnie made a friend in class.

260
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:36,978
What a kid.

261
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,146
She's already making friends.

262
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,149
No, no. She literally made
a new friend.

263
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,192
Hey, it's okay.

264
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,403
Come on out. That's it.

265
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,363
Come on, there you go.

266
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,576
Come on,
let's get you out of there.

267
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,119
You got this.

268
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,037
Good. Good.

269
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,291
Everyone, I want you
to meet Forky.

270
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,042
- Golly bob howdy!
- Look at that!

271
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,378
Look how long his arms are!

272
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,130
- Trash?
- No.

273
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,174
No, toys.

274
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,259
They're all toys.

275
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,512
- Trash?
- No, no, no.

276
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,639
That's the trash.

277
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:14,974
These are your friends.

278
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,601
Hi!

279
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,060
Trash!

280
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,520
- No, no, it's okay.
- Trash!

281
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,813
Woody, I have a question.

282
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,690
Well, actually, not just one,

283
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,816
I have all of them.

284
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,526
I have all the questions.

285
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,028
Why does he want
to go to the trash?

286
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,279
Because he was made from trash.

287
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,363
Trash!

288
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,907
Look, I know
this is a little strange,

289
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,158
but you gotta trust me on this.

290
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,242
Trash?

291
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:36,996
Forky is the most important
toy to Bonnie right now.

292
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,247
Important?

293
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,415
He's a spork.

294
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,209
Yes. Yeah, I know,
but this spork...

295
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,586
this toy is crucial to Bonnie

296
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,838
getting adjusted
to kindergarten.

297
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,048
Woody, aren't you being

298
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,216
a little dramatic
about all this?

299
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,759
I know this is new
to everybody...

300
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,052
but you should see how much

301
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,595
this little guy means to Bonnie.

302
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,264
When she started
playing with him...

303
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,475
she had the biggest smile
on her face.

304
00:16:57,642 --> 00:16:58,809
I wish you could have seen it.

305
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,019
Bonnie was really upset...

306
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,729
and I swear,
once she made Forky...

307
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:03,481
it was
a complete transformation.

308
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,733
- Woody?
- Just a second, Jessie.

309
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,445
So, we all have to make sure
nothing happens to him.

310
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,364
Something happened to him.

311
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,367
Chutes and Ladders!

312
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,535
Trash.

313
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,702
- No, no, no!
- No! No!

314
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,079
You're a toy now,
Forky! Come on!

315
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:19,247
Stop! Stop it!

316
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,790
- Hey! No, no, no! Come on!
- Trash!

317
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,041
Trash! Trash!

318
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,377
Well, I guess
I'll just babysit him

319
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,753
till he's used to the room.

320
00:17:32,969 --> 00:17:34,220
Forky?

321
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,055
Where are you, Forky?

322
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,807
There you are!

323
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,934
I thought I'd lost you, silly.

324
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,158
No, no, no.
Big girl scary!

325
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,869
Like I said before,
Bonnie's not scary.

326
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,788
She loves you and you need to...

327
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,974
Forky?

328
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,103
Bonnie!

329
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,479
Let's go!

330
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,815
Rise and shine!

331
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,567
Who wants to go on a road trip?

332
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,153
Me! I'm gonna bring
Dolly, and Buttercup...

333
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,155
and Forky, and...

334
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:36,073
Forky? Where are you?

335
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:37,533
He's gotta be here somewhere.

336
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:38,618
Forky?

337
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,745
Forky!

338
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,497
Come on. Let's eat some
breakfast and hit the road!

339
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:45,124
Let's go, Forky!

340
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,297
He's quite a handful, Woody.

341
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,049
You need help with him
on the road trip?

342
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,718
No. No, no. I got it,
I got it.

343
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:57,970
We'll just be stuck in an RV.

344
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,805
He can't get far.
I got this.

345
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:00,890
I got it.

346
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,396
I can't let you

347
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,774
I can't let you

348
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:13,444
I can't let you
throw yourself away

349
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:16,989
- I can't let you
- I can't let you

350
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,116
- I can't let you
- I can't let you

351
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,243
I can't let you
throw yourself away

352
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,957
Don't you want to see
the sun come up each morning?

353
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,793
No, no!

354
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,295
Don't you want to see
the sun go down each day?

355
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,967
Don't you want to see that
little girl that loves you so?

356
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,719
Her heart would break

357
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:39,887
Yeah!

358
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,430
If you should go

359
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:44,392
- I can't let you
- I can't let you

360
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,686
- I can't let you
- I can't let you

361
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,937
I can't let you
throw yourself away

362
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,063
No, no, no!

363
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:51,565
No! No! No!

364
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,652
So it seems to me like you're
never gonna behave yourself

365
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:58,322
Since I'm not gonna
do this every day

366
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:04,620
Come tomorrow, you're gonna
have to save yourself

367
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,747
Got nothing more to say

368
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,583
You're not listening anyway

369
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,711
- I can't let you
- I can't let you

370
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,879
- I can't let you
- I can't let you

371
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:15,005
Trash, here I come!

372
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,173
I can't let you
throw yourself away

373
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,383
Come on.

374
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,302
I can't let you

375
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,972
I can't let you

376
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,306
I can't let you
throw yourself away

377
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,350
I don't wanna be a toy!

378
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,770
- I can't let you
- I can't let you

379
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,981
- I can't let you
- I can't let you

380
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:35,818
I can't let you
throw yourself away

381
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,093
Hey, buddy.

382
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,511
Hey, Buzz.

383
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,221
You doing okay?

384
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,389
I don't know, Buzz.

385
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,768
I know you weren't around
when Andy was little...

386
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,562
but I don't remember it
being this hard.

387
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,648
Want me to take the next watch?

388
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:15,733
I'll keep an eye on Forky.

389
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,902
No, no. I need to do this.

390
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,236
That little voice inside me

391
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,447
would never leave me alone
if I gave up.

392
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:25,493
Who do you think it is?

393
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,702
Who?

394
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,413
The voice inside of you.
Who do you think it is?

395
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,666
Me.

396
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,126
You know, my conscience?

397
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,173
That part of you
that tells you things?

398
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,466
What you're really thinking?

399
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,260
Fascinating.

400
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,138
So, your inner voice
advises you.

401
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,306
What?

402
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,227
It's a secret
mission in uncharted space.

403
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,228
Let's go.

404
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,024
Where's Forky?

405
00:21:58,776 --> 00:21:59,944
No!
Forky!

406
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:01,987
Forky!

407
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,614
I am not a toy!

408
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,865
I'm a spork.

409
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:05,950
Be quiet!

410
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,451
I was made for soup, salad...

411
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,620
maybe chili, and then the trash.

412
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:11,080
I'm litter!

413
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,164
Freedom!

414
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,669
Hamm, how far to our next stop?

415
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,462
5.32 miles, give or take.

416
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:19,672
I can make that.

417
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,090
I'll meet you at the RV park.

418
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,092
Woody, hold on a minute.
Woody!

419
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:42,862
Forky!

420
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,490
Forky, where are you?

421
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:48,075
Forky!

422
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:49,618
Forky, where are you?

423
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:09,471
- Carry me?
- No.

424
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:11,891
Why do I have to be a toy?

425
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,100
Because you have Bonnie's name

426
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,727
written on the bottom
of your sticks.

427
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:15,936
Why do I have Bonnie's name

428
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,605
written on the bottom
of my sticks?

429
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,023
Because she...

430
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:24,361
Look, she plays with you
all the time, right?

431
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:25,738
Yes.

432
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,740
And who does she sleep with
every night?

433
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,158
The big white fluffy thing?

434
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,618
No, not her pillow.

435
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,036
You.

436
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,996
All right, Forky.

437
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:37,666
You have to understand
how lucky you are right now.

438
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,001
You're Bonnie's toy.

439
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,378
You are going to help create
happy memories...

440
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,589
that will last
for the rest of her life.

441
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,966
What?

442
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:50,220
Okay.
Doing it for Bonnie.

443
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,389
Doing this for Bonnie,
you're doing it for Bonnie.

444
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:55,726
Okay, like it or not,
you are a toy.

445
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:57,394
Maybe you don't like being one,

446
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:58,687
but you are one nonetheless.

447
00:23:58,771 --> 00:23:59,980
Which means you are going

448
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,231
to be there for Andy when he...

449
00:24:01,315 --> 00:24:02,608
Who's Andy?

450
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,526
I mean, Bonnie.

451
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,278
You have to be there for Bonnie.

452
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,113
That is your job.

453
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,573
Well, what's your job?

454
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,909
Well, right now, it's to make
sure you do yours.

455
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,661
- Carry me?
- No!

456
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,918
Who's Andy?

457
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,630
Andy was my other kid.

458
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,007
You had another kid?

459
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,175
Yeah, yeah.

460
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,885
For a long time.

461
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:33,097
And it was pretty great.

462
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,141
I was a favorite toy, actually.

463
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,478
Running the room was my job.

464
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,021
Keeping all the toys in place...

465
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,899
So, he thought
Andy's room was a planet?

466
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:45,776
That is messed up.

467
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,860
Right!

468
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,570
That's exactly what I thought
when he first showed up.

469
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:50,864
Yeah. I mean,
how is that not annoying?

470
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,200
- Thank you!
- Seriously, that is the...

471
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,119
Well, then you watch 'em grow up

472
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,996
and become a full person.

473
00:24:58,956 --> 00:25:00,541
And then they leave.

474
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,960
They go off and do things
you'll never see.

475
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:07,965
Don't get me wrong,
you still feel good about it.

476
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,800
But then somehow
you find yourself,

477
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,010
after all those years...

478
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,054
sitting in a closet
just feeling...

479
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,180
Useless?

480
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,267
Yeah.

481
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,310
Your purpose fulfilled?

482
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,521
Exactly.

483
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,273
Woody, I know
what your problem is.

484
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,357
You do?

485
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:26,900
You're just like me.

486
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,110
Trash!

487
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,862
What is it with you and trash?

488
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,447
- It's warm.
- Ew.

489
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,865
- It's cozy.
- I guess.

490
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,033
And safe!

491
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,784
Like somebody's
whispering in your ear,

492
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,327
"Everything's gonna be okay."

493
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,747
Forky, that's it.

494
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,624
That's how Bonnie feels
when she's with you.

495
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,376
- She does?
- Yes!

496
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:47,796
Wait a sec.

497
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:51,008
- You mean she thinks I'm warm?
- Yep.

498
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:52,259
And cozy?

499
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,719
And sometimes kinda squishy?

500
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,137
Well, that, too. Yes.

501
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,805
I get it now.

502
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,057
I'm Bonnie's trash.

503
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,266
Yes! Wait, what?

504
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:00,559
I am Bonnie's trash!

505
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:01,727
No, no, no, not exactly.

506
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,145
She must be feeling awful
without me.

507
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,480
Woody, we got to get going,
she needs me!

508
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,440
- Yeah...
- Hey, Bonnie, I'm coming!

509
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:07,816
Forky, slow down! Forky!

510
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,234
Bonnie, I'm coming!

511
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,402
Forky!

512
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:36,178
Forky, look.
Bonnie's right over there.

513
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,471
Hurry!

514
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,160
Woody?

515
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,458
Bo?

516
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:16,760
Woody?

517
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:23,475
Aren't we going to Bonnie?

518
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,936
I know, I know. But my friend
might be in there.

519
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,187
Friend?

520
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,856
A friend...

521
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:30,524
Well, a friend is...

522
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,067
Well, a friend is
like you and me.

523
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,236
- Trash?
- Trash, like... Yes.

524
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,863
And I'm very worried
that she might be lost.

525
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:38,198
But, Woody,
Bonnie's right there.

526
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,367
Yeah, we'll have you back
before she wakes up. Come on.

527
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,503
Bo?

528
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:52,713
Bo?

529
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:55,549
Bo?

530
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,633
Bo?

531
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,304
- Bo?
- Bo?

532
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,139
Bo?

533
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,307
Bo.

534
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,850
Bo, Bo, Bo...

535
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:08,979
- Bo?
- Bo?

536
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,109
Can we go back to Bonnie now?

537
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,360
I don't see your friend.

538
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,987
Yeah, okay.

539
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:18,488
She's not in here.

540
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:19,823
Come on, let's go.

541
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,336
Is that Bo?

542
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,384
Hey, howdy.

543
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,636
Hey there.

544
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,137
Sorry to bother you, but...

545
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,097
Why, you're not a bother at all.

546
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,226
We were just out
for my early morning stroll.

547
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,518
And look...

548
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,520
we met you!

549
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,897
My name is Gabby Gabby.

550
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,441
And this is my
very good friend Benson.

551
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:56,610
Woody.
Pleasure to meet you.

552
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,029
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Woody. And you are...?

553
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,739
This is Forky.

554
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,032
I'm trash.

555
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,909
Our kid made him.

556
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,161
Kid? Toys around here
don't have kids.

557
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:07,329
Are you two lost?

558
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,414
Lost? No, no.

559
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,292
But we are looking
for a lost toy.

560
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,003
She's a figurine. Used to be
on that lamp in the window?

561
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,171
Name's Bo Peep?

562
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,381
Bo Peep?

563
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,675
- Yes, I know Bo.
- You do?

564
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,051
Hop on in.
We'll take you to her.

565
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:22,844
You don't have to do that.

566
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,221
Well, okay.

567
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,809
Benson, be careful
with our new friends.

568
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:32,020
What service.

569
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:40,070
Thank you for your help.

570
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,154
I haven't seen Bo in years.

571
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,073
May I ask, when were you made?

572
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,574
Me?

573
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,451
I'm not sure. Late '50s?

574
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,619
Me, too!

575
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,705
Gee, I wonder if we were made
in the same factory.

576
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,540
Wouldn't that be something?

577
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,625
I gotta say,
you are in great condition.

578
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,837
Well, I try to stay active.

579
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,715
And look at that,
you have a voice box like me.

580
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,882
Benson, show him.

581
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,428
That's really not necessary.

582
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,725
I'm Gabby Gabby

583
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,685
and I love you.

584
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,854
You need to fix that.

585
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:16,857
My record works just fine.

586
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,734
It's the voice box
that's broken.

587
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,901
Does yours still work?

588
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:20,986
Hey!

589
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,487
There's a snake in my boot!

590
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,781
Listen to that!
Let's see it.

591
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,116
I bet it's the same type.

592
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,493
No, thanks, mine's sewn inside.

593
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,162
Is Bo around here?
Because we need...

594
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,125
The store is about to open.

595
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,252
Don't worry, we'll take you
where no one will see us.

596
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:39,171
No. We can't stay.

597
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,464
Yes, you can.

598
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:53,143
We gotta go.

599
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,438
You can't leave yet.
You have what I need.

600
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:59,524
Right inside there.

601
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:01,902
Returned that lamp the next day.

602
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:02,986
You're kidding me!

603
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,780
Mom, can we go to the park now?

604
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:05,989
Harmony!

605
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,327
Stop him, please.

606
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:21,797
What's going on?

607
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,092
Come on! Let's go!

608
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,968
He's coming, he's coming!
I see him!

609
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,012
Forky? We got to get out of...

610
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,430
Woody!

611
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,940
I'd like to join your posse, boys.

612
00:31:40,107 --> 00:31:42,275
But first, I'm gonna sing
a little song.

613
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,991
Grandma, look what I found.

614
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,993
- Can I take it to the park?
- Sure.

615
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,830
Mom, she has enough toys
from the store.

616
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:58,166
It's fine.
Nobody buys the toys anyway.

617
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,043
Thanks, Grandma!

618
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,922
Yee-haw!

619
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,633
Mom, can we go to the carnival?

620
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,218
We're going to the park.

621
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,302
Maybe later, sweetie.

622
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,686
Any sign of Woody?

623
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,062
I don't see him!

624
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,983
Maybe we should
have gone with the fork.

625
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,151
The spoon is safer.

626
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:30,407
Forky?

627
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:31,908
Where's Forky?

628
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,327
Mom! Dad!

629
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,620
- What's wrong, honey?
- Are you okay?

630
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:37,622
I can't find Forky!
He's missing!

631
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,207
Bonnie, it'll be all right.

632
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,042
I'm sure he's here somewhere.

633
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,419
You know, if you don't find him,

634
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,503
you can make a new one.

635
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,797
No! There's only one Forky!

636
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,383
Let's go look outside.

637
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:49,885
Maybe he fell on the ground
somewhere.

638
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:51,678
Poor Bonnie.

639
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:52,929
We're gonna find him, okay?

640
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:55,390
We have to find him,
Mom. He needs me.

641
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,600
Woody was right.

642
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,810
We all should have been
safeguarding the utensil.

643
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,145
Why isn't Woody back yet?

644
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:01,354
Do you think he's lost?

645
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,981
- Buzz, what do we do?
- What do we do, Buzz?

646
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,733
Buzz, what do we do?
What do we do, Buzz?

647
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,401
- What do we do, Buzz? Buzz!
- I...

648
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,028
- Buzz.
- What would Woody do?

649
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,696
Jump out of a moving vehicle.

650
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,490
What would Woody do?

651
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,783
It's a secret mission

652
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,452
in uncharted space. Let's go!

653
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:18,246
I think I have to go.

654
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,414
- Where?
- Where you goin'? Why?

655
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:20,499
Should we all go?

656
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:21,583
- Are we going?
- And then what?

657
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,084
No time to explain!
Attack!

658
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,503
No time to explain!

659
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:25,879
- No!
- Buzz!

660
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,964
Okay, what is with everyone
jumping out the window?

661
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,725
Woody and Forky were last seen
on the highway.

662
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,393
But where is the highway?

663
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,771
The slingshot
maneuver is all we've got!

664
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:44,356
Full speed ahead!

665
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,527
Thanks, inner voice!

666
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,201
Hi-ya!

667
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,455
The highway.

668
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,624
On my way, Woody!

669
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,269
Rad.

670
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,063
Hey! Step right up!

671
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,231
Put your money down!

672
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,357
Get yourself
a real Buzz Lightyear!

673
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,942
Hey! Hey!

674
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,575
Harmony, honey. Sunscreen.

675
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,742
Okay.

676
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,995
Be right back, Mr. Cowboy.

677
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,922
Okay. Antique store,
antique store...

678
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,090
That way!

679
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,736
Did you see 'em?
How many are there?

680
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,071
We got a busload of campers!

681
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:17,115
Here they come!

682
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,491
Playtime, baby!

683
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,882
Baby!
It's a good day to play?

684
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,175
Am I right?

685
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:51,608
"Hello, Mr. Cowboy.
How are you today?

686
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,568
"Do you like riding horses?"

687
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,163
Wanna play on the swings?

688
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:06,456
Wait for me!

689
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,125
Bo?

690
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,251
Come on.

691
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,595
Bo!

692
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,055
I can't believe it's you!

693
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:23,598
Bo Peep!

694
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,308
I never thought
I'd see you again!

695
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,523
- So, which kid is yours?
- Which one is yours?

696
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,732
- None.
- No one.

697
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:34,943
- Wait, you're a lost toy?
- You're a lost toy?

698
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,319
- That's awful.
- That's great.

699
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,072
I mean, awfully great...

700
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,991
that you are lost out here.

701
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,160
- Skunk, skunk, skunk!
- Watch out!

702
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,834
I told you not to drive so fast.

703
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,210
You almost ran him over.

704
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:55,422
Hey, guys!

705
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,798
Hold on there!

706
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,758
Okay!
I missed you, too.

707
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,845
If it isn't Bobby?
Gus?

708
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,139
Lefty?

709
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,432
Billy, Goat, and Gruff.

710
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,267
Right! Right! Right!
Sorry, guys.

711
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,102
- Girls.
- Girls! Of course!

712
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,312
All right, all right.

713
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,649
Okay, let's get a look at you.
You need any repairs?

714
00:37:14,816 --> 00:37:16,776
Repairs? No, I'm fine.

715
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,945
Hey! Nice find, girls.

716
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,196
Where did you get
all this stuff?

717
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,281
Here and there.

718
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,117
You know, some kids
play rougher than others...

719
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:25,869
so I try to be prepared.

720
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,495
How long have you been
out on your own?

721
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,372
Seven fantastic years!

722
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:30,540
Seven?

723
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:33,042
You would not believe
the things I've seen.

724
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:34,377
No.

725
00:37:34,544 --> 00:37:35,587
- Gigs.
- Yo!

726
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,630
Come on out. There's someone
I want you to meet.

727
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,215
Be right down.

728
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,097
What's the situation?
We heading out of town or...

729
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,515
Who's this?

730
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,350
You remember the rag doll
I told you about?

731
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,643
- The cowboy?
- Yep!

732
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,480
No way!

733
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:56,775
- Don't stare.
- I'm totally staring.

734
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,486
Woody, this is Giggle McDimples.

735
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:01,905
Hi, Giggle.

736
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,865
You didn't tell me he was a cop.

737
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,200
Howdy, Sheriff.

738
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,826
Officer Giggle McDimples.

739
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,745
I run Pet Patrol
for Mini-Opolis.

740
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:09,954
Yeah, search and rescue.

741
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,122
Ants, caterpillars,

742
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,749
- miniature poodles, spiders.
- Hut! Hut! Hut!

743
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,501
Carl! Where you headed?

744
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,294
Combat Carl just heard
there's a birthday party...

745
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:17,921
at the playground
on Main Street.

746
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,672
Rumor has it
they got two piñatas.

747
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,091
- That could be 20 to 30 kids.
- Nice!

748
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:25,011
Yeah! Combat Carl's
gettin' played with!

749
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,679
You guys in?

750
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,349
You bet! Woody,
you are gonna love this!

751
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,309
No, I can't, sir.

752
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:33,144
Bo, I need to get back
to my kid.

753
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,854
- What?
- You got a kid?

754
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,022
Yeah.

755
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,524
Way to beat the odds, soldier.

756
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,692
Meet you
at the playground, Peep.

757
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:42,445
Combat Carl's got
a piñata party to crash.

758
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,781
All right, move out.
Hut! Hut! Hut!

759
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,368
So, you're with a kid?

760
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,577
It's not Andy, is it?

761
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,663
No, no, no.
He went off to college.

762
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,623
But he gave us to Bonnie.

763
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,625
- You have a little girl?
- No way!

764
00:38:55,792 --> 00:38:57,210
Yeah, yeah.
It's why I'm out here.

765
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:58,670
Her other toy is trapped

766
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,921
in this antique store,
and I have to...

767
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,756
Second Chance Antiques?

768
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,174
We know that store.

769
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,759
That's great. That is great!

770
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:06,469
If you know the store,
you could really

771
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,762
- help me find him...
- No way.

772
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:08,930
We wasted years there,

773
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,473
just sitting on the shelf,
collecting dust.

774
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,100
Bo, that's awful.

775
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,351
But I don't have a choice.

776
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,144
I have to get that toy
from Gabby.

777
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,896
Steer clear of that weirdo.

778
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,315
If I were you, I'd cut
my losses and go home.

779
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,526
But Bonnie needs him
to get through kindergarten.

780
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,903
Kids lose toys every day.
Bonnie will get over it.

781
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,572
No, no...

782
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:29,284
You see, Bonnie needs him
just like Molly needed you.

783
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,245
No. Sorry, girls.

784
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:33,705
Molly's not here.

785
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,707
Molly? Bo,
I didn't know you had a kid.

786
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:37,709
That was a long time ago.

787
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:40,003
Bo's kid was something special.

788
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,796
She was the cutest thing...

789
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:43,590
but so afraid of the dark.

790
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:45,341
It was just a phase.

791
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,801
You weren't there
in the beginning.

792
00:39:46,968 --> 00:39:48,887
Hearing Molly cry each night...

793
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,180
it broke every toy's heart.

794
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,642
And then, Bo came into the room.

795
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:58,605
Her lamp was the only thing
that made Molly feel safe.

796
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:00,773
Mom would let her keep Bo on
all night.

797
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,734
Who knew you were such a softy?

798
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,152
And Molly would fall asleep

799
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,321
with her hand
resting on Bo's feet.

800
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,656
Okay! Okay. I get it.

801
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,577
Bo, my kid really needs
this toy.

802
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,414
Will you help me?
For old times' sake.

803
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,626
All right, all right.

804
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,419
Thank you!

805
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,587
- Thank you!
- All right.

806
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,505
Guess we're doing this.
Let's ride!

807
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,011
Second Chance Antiques,
and step on it.

808
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,533
Hey, hey!

809
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:54,869
Benson, are we finished?

810
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:56,579
That feels great!

811
00:40:56,746 --> 00:40:58,331
Look at that! Good as new.

812
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:00,959
Yeah. Thank you, Benson.

813
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,046
So, when's Woody coming back?

814
00:41:05,213 --> 00:41:06,881
Like I said, soon.

815
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,257
He won't forget about you.

816
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,425
How do you know?

817
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,136
You have your child's name
written on your feet.

818
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,304
Sticks.

819
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,682
That makes you
a very important toy.

820
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,392
That's exactly what Woody says.

821
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,394
Interesting.

822
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,520
Hi, Grandma!
We're back!

823
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:21,688
She's back.

824
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,190
Who is she?

825
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,317
Harmony.

826
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,485
Wait a second...

827
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:28,861
she took Woody.

828
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,321
Did she lose him?

829
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,408
No. My Harmony is perfect.

830
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,580
Forky, it's tea time.
It's tea time.

831
00:41:39,664 --> 00:41:42,709
- What is tea time?
- I'll show you.

832
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,171
A little bit of milk,
two lumps of sugar.

833
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,264
I've been practicing.
How do I look?

834
00:41:57,849 --> 00:41:58,975
A little higher.

835
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:01,019
Stick out your pinky.

836
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,395
Nice!

837
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,355
Delicious!

838
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,190
Harmony, sweetie, I'm leaving.

839
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:07,608
Come give me a hug.

840
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,694
Bye, Mom.
I love you.

841
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,043
When my voice box is fixed...

842
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:29,005
I'll finally get my chance.

843
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:43,895
Now, about our friend Woody.

844
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:46,522
I wanna know
everything about him.

845
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:47,857
Yeah, Woody.

846
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,817
I've known that guy
my whole life. Two days!

847
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,236
Hey, did you know that
Bonnie was not his first kid?

848
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,322
He had this other kid, Andy.

849
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,406
And you know what?

850
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,491
I don't think
he's ever gotten over him.

851
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,338
Hey, Lightyear.

852
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:12,090
Hey, up here, Astro-boy.

853
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,841
If you think you can
just show up

854
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:15,718
and take our top prize spot...

855
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:16,969
- you're wrong!
- Dead wrong!

856
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,721
You don't understand.
I'm trying to...

857
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:20,765
Cheat the system and get
with a kid? Yeah, we know.

858
00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:22,308
No, I need...

859
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,310
A child to shower you
with unconditional love?

860
00:43:24,477 --> 00:43:26,521
- Join the club, pal.
- Yeah, join the club!

861
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,147
Come on, help me get outta here.

862
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,066
I'll help you. With my foot!

863
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,651
Get him.

864
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,402
Get him.

865
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:34,654
Bunny, what are you doing?

866
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,073
I can't reach him.
Help me out here, come on.

867
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,033
Sorry, Ducky. I'm not
a mind reader, you know.

868
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,952
What's not to understand?

869
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,120
You gonna make me say it?

870
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,871
What?

871
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:46,415
With these tiny legs, I cannot
reach without your help.

872
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:47,625
Okay?
This is what

873
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,793
I've been talking about, Bunny.

874
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,128
You need to work
on paying attention

875
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:51,254
and your listening skills.

876
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:54,215
How you like that, cheater?

877
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,759
Yeah!

878
00:43:56,843 --> 00:44:00,096
To infinity and my foot!
Boom!

879
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,682
In a galaxy far, far away,
you got kicked in the head!

880
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,766
Boom!

881
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,268
How do I get out of here?

882
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:06,853
This planet is toxic.

883
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,688
Closing helmet
to conserve oxygen.

884
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,773
In the vacuum of space,
they cannot hear you scream!

885
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,192
Let go of me!

886
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,569
Get off of me!

887
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:16,863
So, that's what
gravity feel like.

888
00:44:16,946 --> 00:44:17,947
Yeah, that's it.

889
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,031
Hey, where you going?

890
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,993
You better get
over here, spaceman!

891
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,786
Yeah, put us back up there!

892
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,580
Bunny, what are you doing?
He's getting away, let's go!

893
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,664
- I'm trying!
- Come on!

894
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,210
Antique store, here we come!

895
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,129
Bo, why do you ride around
in a skunk?

896
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,089
Skunk!

897
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:36,382
A skunk!

898
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,176
I get it. Smart.

899
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,844
Corndogs, corndogs, corndogs!

900
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,560
Why are you so bad at driving?

901
00:44:47,727 --> 00:44:49,520
You got six eyes.

902
00:44:49,812 --> 00:44:51,480
Thanks for the landing.

903
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:54,108
Come on, follow me.

904
00:44:59,906 --> 00:45:00,907
- I'm fine.
- His face!

905
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,366
- That's hilarious.
- I'm fine. Don't worry.

906
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,910
Happens all the time.

907
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,077
Tape!

908
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,537
Not a bad hiding spot.

909
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:07,914
Yeah.
Leave the skunk.

910
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,373
- We'll fix it later.
- 10-4.

911
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,250
This will be more fun.

912
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,752
Let's get you to that store!

913
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,339
Okay, spill it.
The cowboy, what's the deal?

914
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,840
There's no deal.

915
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:20,092
Don't do this to yourself.
Cowboy's got a kid.

916
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,303
- Giggle...
- Trust me. I've been there.

917
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,597
You know about me and He-Man.
I'm not proud.

918
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,057
Here he comes!

919
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,725
- Oh, man...
- What?

920
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,143
No, not you.

921
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,103
Second Chance Antiques,
straight ahead.

922
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,605
Heavy foot traffic
at the entrance.

923
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,190
Easiest way in is

924
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,274
- the roof.
- The roof!

925
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,236
Let's go antiquing.

926
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,115
Hold on!

927
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:47,995
How did you end up here?

928
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,580
I thought you were given
to a new family.

929
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,915
You know how it goes.

930
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,208
Their little girl grew up

931
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,961
and didn't need me anymore,
so...

932
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:56,462
I'm sorry, Bo.

933
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,464
Who needs a kid's room...

934
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:02,635
when you can have all of this?

935
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,524
Whatcha looking at, Sheriff?

936
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:17,942
What?

937
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,278
That wasn't...
No, nothing.

938
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,780
I was looking at the store.
Right there.

939
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,573
I was looking
at the antique store.

940
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,617
- Giggle, count us down.
- Five.

941
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:27,827
- Countdown for what?
- Four.

942
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,120
You want to get to the store,
don't you?

943
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,204
Three. Two. One!

944
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,759
The highway exit
has to be somewhere.

945
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,261
Where is it?

946
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:47,471
Meteor shower! Look out!

947
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:48,848
Woody?

948
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,017
Good work, inner voice.

949
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,519
So, how about you?
How's your new kid?

950
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:56,063
Bonnie?
She's great.

951
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:57,273
Jessie is loving it.

952
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,441
Jessie's still with you?

953
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,651
Yeah, the whole gang's
still together.

954
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,320
Well, I mean, most of us.

955
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:05,740
What about Rex?

956
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,908
Yeah, yeah, Rex,
Bullseye, Slinky...

957
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:09,744
- the Potato Heads...
- Buzz?

958
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:10,995
Yeah, Buzz, too.

959
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,956
I cannot wait to see his face
when he hears that I found...

960
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:15,875
- Bo Peep?
- Buzz!

961
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:17,668
- My old moving buddy!
- Buzz?

962
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:18,836
It's so good to see you!

963
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,046
Woody, it's Bo Peep!

964
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,881
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

965
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:24,717
Buzz... Buzz... Buzz...

966
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,801
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

967
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,219
- Three years!
- Three years!

968
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,304
That's how long we've been

969
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:29,597
hanging up there
waiting for a kid!

970
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,765
Look, I'm sorry about that.

971
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,808
You ruined our lives.
Shame on you!

972
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,560
Who are these guys?

973
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,395
- Lightyear promised us a kid.
- You did what?

974
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,897
I did not.

975
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,565
- Hey! Wait a minute!
- Eat my plush!

976
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,649
All right now, come on, stop it!

977
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,817
Cut it out now!

978
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:42,985
Come on, guys, break it up.

979
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,153
Guys, I have a kid!

980
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,447
You got a kid?

981
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:47,615
Like a kid-kid?

982
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,909
Like a human kid,
not a baby goat?

983
00:47:50,076 --> 00:47:52,036
Yeah. Now let go of Buzz
and come with me.

984
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:53,287
I'll take you to Bonnie.

985
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:54,830
- We're gettin' a kid?
- Yes!

986
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,040
We're gettin' a kid?

987
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,958
- We're gonna get a kid
- Kid

988
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,502
- We're getting a kid
- All right, let's go.

989
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,045
- We gonna get something,
- We gonna

990
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,297
- Where's Forky?
- Long story.

991
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:05,925
- Kid, we get a kid
- Kid, kid, kid

992
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,552
- We gonna kid
- We gonna kid, kid

993
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,889
He's not anywhere.

994
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:14,517
Forky's gone.

995
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:16,185
Honey, I'm sorry.

996
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,771
Okay. Let's look outside
one more time.

997
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:21,565
But then we have to keep
driving, okay?

998
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,195
They're about to leave!

999
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:27,780
- Leaving?
- They can't do that!

1000
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,824
The panic is attacking me!

1001
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,909
- Hey! Watch it, buddy!
- What do we do?

1002
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,411
- We have to stop them!
- How?

1003
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:36,038
We could frame Dad for
a crime so he goes to jail.

1004
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:38,582
Or go back in time and warn
Woody about the future.

1005
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,834
That's crazy.
Time is a flat circle.

1006
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:40,918
Jessie!

1007
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,257
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

1008
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,341
We looked everywhere.

1009
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,676
But we need
to get going now, okay?

1010
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,052
Can we please leave a note
for Forky...

1011
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:51,679
so he knows where we're going?

1012
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,973
He has to go to kindergarten.

1013
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:59,019
Are you kidding me?
I can't...

1014
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:02,690
Everything is going perfect...
I just bought it.

1015
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:04,733
Okay! Daddy's
going to use some words.

1016
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:06,277
How about we go to the carnival?

1017
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:09,071
Or maybe check out
some of those shops in town?

1018
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,490
What did you do?

1019
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,827
We're not going anywhere.
If you get my point.

1020
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:15,995
- Brilliant!
- That was genius!

1021
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:17,079
Nice work, Jessie!

1022
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,082
I'm sure Buzz and Woody are on
their way back right now.

1023
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:26,255
Forky is in there?

1024
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,339
Yeah.

1025
00:49:27,423 --> 00:49:28,424
Now, hold on.
I have a question.

1026
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,051
Who will Bonnie love more?
Ducky or me? Say me.

1027
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,678
- No, say Ducky. Ducky.
- Bunny. Bunny.

1028
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:33,846
Okay, guys.
Playtime is over.

1029
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:35,347
You have to follow my lead.

1030
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,058
We stay together,
we stay quiet. Are we clear?

1031
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,810
Absolutely.
Lead the way.

1032
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:02,958
- Are you kidding me?
- Move over.

1033
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:04,126
- You move over.
- Quit pushing me.

1034
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,461
Stop.

1035
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,630
My maker!
That sheep has three heads!

1036
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:08,714
No, no, no!

1037
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,217
What? All six eyes
just looked into my soul.

1038
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,635
Gonna have nightmares.

1039
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,059
That's most likely where
your Forky is being kept.

1040
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,144
All right, this isn't so bad.

1041
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:24,271
We just can't be seen
by the dummies.

1042
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,731
Not just the dummies.

1043
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:29,318
Her cabinet is surrounded
by a moat of exposed aisle.

1044
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:31,695
Where Dragon roams.

1045
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,156
- We can handle a cat.
- No.

1046
00:50:34,323 --> 00:50:35,574
Not this one.

1047
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,872
Is that how we look
on the inside?

1048
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,291
- There's so much...
- fluff.

1049
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,668
So, how do you propose
we get up there?

1050
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,545
We could go straight across.

1051
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,380
- How?
- That's quite a jump.

1052
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:51,423
We know the perfect toy to help.

1053
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,841
Bonnie, check it out.

1054
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:54,677
- Look at all this cool stuff.
- Bonnie?

1055
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:56,428
We gotta get Forky now!

1056
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:57,805
Woody, don't...

1057
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,348
- Stick to the plan.
- 10-4.

1058
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,141
- Follow me.
- Roger that.

1059
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:08,899
Woody just sits in the closet?
With no playtime?

1060
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:11,277
Yeah, he told me himself,
he's useless.

1061
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,528
That's awful.

1062
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:13,988
Such pretty hair...

1063
00:51:14,613 --> 00:51:15,739
What are you doing?

1064
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:16,991
You need to stick to the plan.

1065
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,617
But it's Bonnie.
She's right...

1066
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,286
Can we go to the carnival, too?

1067
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,453
...there.

1068
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:23,539
Come on. Stay quiet.

1069
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,249
You better hope
the dummies didn't...

1070
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,080
My sheep!

1071
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:14,381
What did I say?
I lead. You follow.

1072
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,259
Bo, I'm so sorry. Really.
Just tell me how to help.

1073
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:18,510
You really wanna help?

1074
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:21,138
Then stay out of my way.
I'm getting my sheep back.

1075
00:52:21,347 --> 00:52:22,348
What about the others?

1076
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,974
Giggle knows what to do.

1077
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,063
- Here you go.
- That's our objective.

1078
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,106
We have to get that key.

1079
00:52:31,273 --> 00:52:32,566
It's the only way
inside the cabinet.

1080
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,068
You can't be serious.

1081
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,361
How are we supposed to do that?

1082
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,779
Okay.

1083
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,197
You know what, leave that to us.

1084
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:40,324
We know exactly what to do.

1085
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,329
Where did you two come from?

1086
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,706
The keys! Give 'em
up now! Where are they?

1087
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,249
Give us the keys!
Give us the keys!

1088
00:52:49,917 --> 00:52:51,001
Well, we're not doing that.

1089
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,252
Yeah, yeah, I agree,
too visible.

1090
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:53,629
It's a good point.
Something more subtle.

1091
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,172
What about "Winner,
winner, chicken dinner"?

1092
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,256
Yes.

1093
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,890
The keys! Give 'em
up now! Where are they?

1094
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,017
- ...you're kidding.
- Really?

1095
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,727
Okay, okay. You just...

1096
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,104
All right. Well...

1097
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,147
What about the old "Plush Rush"?

1098
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,357
There you go!

1099
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,580
- Where is this going?
- Don't interrupt.

1100
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,055
Okay, right?

1101
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,307
Not gonna happen.
N-O.

1102
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,143
Okay, do you want
the key or not?

1103
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,436
What is wrong with you?

1104
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:51,520
What is wrong with...?

1105
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,647
We just gave you
three brilliant ideas.

1106
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,065
It's one thing to say no.

1107
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:56,734
It's another to offer
a reason...

1108
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,318
How do we get that key?

1109
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,160
You're kidding!

1110
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,411
Really?

1111
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,787
Woody's back?

1112
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:09,997
Woody's back?

1113
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:11,957
And you're sure it's Bo Peep
who's with him?

1114
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:14,460
Thank you, Benson.

1115
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,836
Make sure the others are ready.

1116
00:54:17,755 --> 00:54:18,922
Woody's back!

1117
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,091
I'm coming, Bonnie!

1118
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,051
Bonnie.

1119
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:25,179
First, we must prepare
for his arrival.

1120
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,388
Prepare?

1121
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:27,598
Have you ever played
hide-and-seek?

1122
00:54:27,765 --> 00:54:29,892
No. But it sounds complicated.

1123
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,059
It's easy.

1124
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,686
- I'll teach you, okay?
- Okay.

1125
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,271
The first thing you do is...

1126
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:36,523
one of us finds a place
to hide...

1127
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:37,608
Scary.

1128
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,067
...while
the other one counts to ten...

1129
00:54:39,151 --> 00:54:40,778
then tries to find them.

1130
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:00,255
What are we doing?

1131
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:03,175
Just stand there and be quiet!

1132
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:10,057
I'll do the talking.

1133
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,060
Hi, Tinny!

1134
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,853
Nice to see you, too.

1135
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,940
Yeah, he's with me.

1136
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:19,608
My friend? No, no, no.

1137
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,527
He's my accessory.

1138
00:55:21,777 --> 00:55:23,487
- Hey, guys.
- Bo!

1139
00:55:23,654 --> 00:55:25,739
Long time no see.

1140
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,282
Couldn't take it out there?

1141
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:28,617
Hey, Doug.
Saw your better half

1142
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,785
at the front of the store.

1143
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:32,329
Yeah, you mess with the cat,
you get the claws.

1144
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,413
Bo came back!

1145
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:34,665
Magic 8-Ball was right!

1146
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,792
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- What are you doing here?

1147
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,836
I thought the store
had no return policy!

1148
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,128
Bo, help me out.

1149
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:41,463
I need a battery.

1150
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:44,299
We got to get
this wagon train a-movin'!

1151
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:45,801
- Agreed.
- Help, help, help.

1152
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:46,885
Cheater.

1153
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,178
Have you seen Duke?

1154
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,638
He's in the back.

1155
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,773
Look who jumped 40 school buses

1156
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,066
and landed back into my life.

1157
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:03,360
- Hi, Duke!
- Who's the cowboy?

1158
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,237
Duke, meet Woody.
Woody, meet...

1159
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,448
Duke Caboom.
Canada's greatest stuntman.

1160
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,117
Yeah!

1161
00:56:11,285 --> 00:56:12,411
Yes!

1162
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,996
He's posing.

1163
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,664
Duke?

1164
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:17,833
- Duke, we need to...
- Hold on. One more.

1165
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,168
Yeah!
What brings you back, Peep?

1166
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,378
We need your help.

1167
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:24,715
Gabby Gabby has his toy
and my sheep.

1168
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:27,926
No. Billy, Goat, and Gruff?
Those are my girls.

1169
00:56:28,594 --> 00:56:30,137
What were you doing
getting tangled up

1170
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,597
with Gabby Gabby?
You know better.

1171
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,099
Yeah, some toy thought
it would be a good idea...

1172
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,267
to wander into the aisle.

1173
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,852
That doesn't make any sense.

1174
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:38,186
It doesn't, does it?

1175
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:40,606
Everybody knows the best route
is behind the shelves.

1176
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,983
That would have been
a better route, wouldn't it?

1177
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,985
This toy sounds like
a complete idiot.

1178
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,695
He does!

1179
00:56:46,778 --> 00:56:48,572
Wait, are you that toy?

1180
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,490
So, here's the plan.

1181
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:53,201
We need to jump over the aisle
to Gabby's cabinet.

1182
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:56,079
- And you are the toy to do it.
- No.

1183
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:57,331
- Duke.
- Nope.

1184
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:58,790
- Duke? Duke?
- No way!

1185
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:00,292
- Duke. Duke!
- Pass. Negative.

1186
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:01,460
- Duke.
- Rejected.

1187
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:03,503
Please, Mr. Caboom,
this is really important.

1188
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:04,630
My kid...

1189
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:05,797
You have a kid?

1190
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:10,052
Hey, Duke, show us some more
poses, what do you say?

1191
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:12,137
- I had a kid.
- No.

1192
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,931
Rejean.

1193
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:17,559
Rejean was so excited when
he got me after Christmas.

1194
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:21,063
It was the happiest Boxing Day
of my life.

1195
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,190
That's Duke Caboom,

1196
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,525
riding the amazing
Caboom stunt cycle!

1197
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,110
Caboom!

1198
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,822
I was ready to finally
do what I was made to do.

1199
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,449
Caboom!

1200
00:57:32,616 --> 00:57:34,451
But when Rejean realized
I couldn't jump

1201
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,119
as far as the toy
in the commercial...

1202
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,332
It's a commercial!
It's not real!

1203
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:41,917
Rejean threw me away!

1204
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:43,210
It's not fair!

1205
00:57:43,377 --> 00:57:45,253
Why, Rejean? Why?

1206
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:50,092
Okay, okay.
Calm down, Duke.

1207
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,802
That was a long time ago.

1208
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,179
Right now, we need the only toy

1209
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:56,682
who can crash us
onto Gabby's cabinet.

1210
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:57,766
Crash?

1211
00:57:57,849 --> 00:57:58,850
Crash?

1212
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:00,978
Any Duke Caboom toy can land...

1213
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:04,940
but you are the only one
that can crash the way you do.

1214
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:06,441
- I am?
- Yes!

1215
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,027
Forget Rejean.
Forget your commercial.

1216
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,405
Be the Duke you are right now...

1217
00:58:11,571 --> 00:58:14,616
the one who jumps and crashes!

1218
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:21,665
Be who I am right now.

1219
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,751
Who's the Canuck
with all the luck?

1220
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:26,586
Caboom?

1221
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,547
Who's the greatest
of the Great White North?

1222
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:29,631
Caboom!

1223
00:58:29,715 --> 00:58:31,425
Who's the most spectacular
daredevil

1224
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,676
Canada has ever seen?

1225
00:58:32,968 --> 00:58:34,469
Duke Caboom!

1226
00:58:34,845 --> 00:58:35,929
Can you do the jump?

1227
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,140
Yes, I Canada!

1228
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:43,937
- We've got our ride.
- Yes!

1229
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,856
Yee-haw!

1230
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,607
Yo, Bo!

1231
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,609
Gigs! You made it!

1232
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,028
Good work!

1233
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,362
How'd you get it?

1234
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,781
How do we get that key?

1235
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:01,705
- It was hard.
- Very difficult.

1236
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,331
- Barely made it out alive.
- Yeah.

1237
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,541
So, you're welcome.

1238
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:06,710
Okay. Let's do this.

1239
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,463
Let me wrap that up for you.

1240
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,090
Don't want anything to happen
to it on the way home.

1241
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,426
Good. That sale buys us
some time.

1242
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:16,720
Wait for it.

1243
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,766
All right, let's go!

1244
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:04,518
So, how long were you in here?

1245
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,061
I don't know.
Couple years.

1246
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:09,397
I didn't wanna sit on a shelf
waiting for my life to happen.

1247
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,565
So, I left.

1248
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:14,319
You've handled this lost toy
life better than I could.

1249
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,154
Sheriff.

1250
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:18,198
You're selling yourself short.

1251
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:22,452
I think you'd make
a great lost toy.

1252
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,038
You really don't think

1253
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:26,915
you'll ever be in a kid's room
again?

1254
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:28,083
Nope.

1255
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,709
And now with the carnival
traveling through,

1256
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:30,836
it's our chance to hop a ride...

1257
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,004
- and leave town.
- You're leaving?

1258
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:34,172
Sure am.

1259
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,424
You ever think about getting
out there, seeing the world?

1260
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,260
Without a kid?

1261
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:41,221
No. You can't teach
this old toy new tricks.

1262
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,306
You'd be surprised.

1263
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,727
So, how'd you end up in
this store in the first place?

1264
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:50,188
Well, I saw your lamp
in the window...

1265
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:53,817
and I thought maybe
you were inside...

1266
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,944
and so I...

1267
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,285
Yeah.

1268
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:05,704
Will you look at that?

1269
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:10,000
This is the only part
of the store I ever liked.

1270
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:20,927
That's gonna be quite a jump
for you and Duke.

1271
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:23,430
For me?

1272
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,352
Didn't I tell you?
You're going with him.

1273
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:30,437
I am?

1274
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,856
Let's caboom.

1275
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,399
It'll be fine, Duke's the best.

1276
01:01:34,566 --> 01:01:36,067
Yeah, at crashing.

1277
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:41,406
And now!

1278
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,743
Go!

1279
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,253
Rejean.

1280
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,964
It's a commercial.
It's not real!

1281
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,217
I can't do this!
I'm sorry, Rejean!

1282
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,010
No, no, no!

1283
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:12,687
What's new, pussycat?

1284
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:24,866
- Forky?
- Girls?

1285
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,701
Forky, where are you?

1286
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,495
You're never gonna find me.

1287
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:29,663
Forky?

1288
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,916
Woody!
How'd you find me?

1289
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,876
- Bo, I found him!
- Hi.

1290
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:37,629
Wait, it's an actual fork?

1291
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,339
Bo! Bo! Bo!

1292
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:41,049
Buzz!
The dummies are gone!

1293
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:43,093
What?
Where'd they go?

1294
01:02:45,345 --> 01:02:46,346
Okay, we can go now!

1295
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,556
- No. I need to find my girls.
- Hello, Woody.

1296
01:02:48,932 --> 01:02:49,933
Hi, Bo.

1297
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,434
- Where are my sheep?
- Yeah!

1298
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:52,811
Look! Woody found me!

1299
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:55,021
Take the bunny!
I'm too cute to die!

1300
01:02:57,357 --> 01:02:58,858
No, no!

1301
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:00,443
Woody!

1302
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,363
- I just wanna talk.
- Yeah, with my voice box!

1303
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:05,782
Pull!

1304
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:10,161
You're my favorite deputy.

1305
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,498
Somebody's poisoned
the water hole.

1306
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,000
I'd like to join your posse.

1307
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,294
Reach for the sky!

1308
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:30,181
Girls!

1309
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,641
Drop it.

1310
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,022
No! No!
Forky!

1311
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:38,273
- We've gotta go!
- Wait!

1312
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,608
Forky!

1313
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:44,279
Woody!

1314
01:03:57,709 --> 01:03:58,835
Bonnie's backpack?

1315
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:07,385
Giggle!

1316
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:10,805
Don't let Woody leave!

1317
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:14,726
Grab on!

1318
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:20,899
Duke, get us out of here!

1319
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:22,067
Oui!

1320
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:24,778
Here, kitty, kitty!

1321
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,613
Wait! We don't have Forky!

1322
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,073
Woody!

1323
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,036
Forky!

1324
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:53,807
Is everyone okay?

1325
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,479
It's okay.

1326
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:01,189
It's okay.

1327
01:05:01,773 --> 01:05:03,650
Bunny? Bunny?

1328
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:07,362
Bunny!
No, no, no, no.

1329
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:10,073
No, no, no, no.

1330
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:13,576
- Bunny!
- It's gonna be okay.

1331
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:14,661
Forky's still in there.

1332
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,329
If we hurry, we can get him
before they lock him up.

1333
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:17,705
You want us to go back in there?

1334
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:18,998
We barely got out alive.

1335
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:20,417
Woody, it's better if we wait.

1336
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:21,960
No, no, no. There's no time.
We can easily get back inside.

1337
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:23,044
But I saw Bonnie's...

1338
01:05:23,128 --> 01:05:24,170
By my count, there were
only four dummies.

1339
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:25,255
But the backpack...

1340
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:26,381
We outnumber them.
So we have the advantage.

1341
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:27,799
Woody, look at us!

1342
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:33,930
Nobody is with you.
It's over, okay?

1343
01:05:34,097 --> 01:05:36,266
No. No, no, no. We are
wasting time. We can do this.

1344
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,268
- Come on, Pull-string.
- It's not worth it.

1345
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:39,394
Yeah, yes, listen to her!

1346
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,312
- Nobody wants this!
- I do!

1347
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:42,522
- Why?
- Because!

1348
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:44,441
- Why?
- Just because!

1349
01:05:44,524 --> 01:05:45,525
Why?

1350
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:46,901
Because it's all
I have left to do!

1351
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:51,406
I don't have anything else.

1352
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:54,451
So, the rest of us don't count?

1353
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:57,495
That's not what I meant.

1354
01:05:57,662 --> 01:05:59,038
Bonnie needs Forky.

1355
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:01,624
No. You need Bonnie!

1356
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,042
Open your eyes, Woody.

1357
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:05,044
There's plenty of kids
out there.

1358
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:09,257
It can't be just about the one
you're still clinging to.

1359
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,259
It's called loyalty.

1360
01:06:11,426 --> 01:06:13,261
Something a lost toy
wouldn't understand.

1361
01:06:21,269 --> 01:06:23,313
I'm not the one who's lost.

1362
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:26,065
Let's get out of here.

1363
01:06:26,232 --> 01:06:28,735
We've got a carnival
that leaves in the morning.

1364
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:30,195
Come on.

1365
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:32,989
We'll find our own kid.

1366
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,532
You're crazy.

1367
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:38,244
Bo!

1368
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:41,664
Bye, Woody.
Good luck with Bonnie.

1369
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:50,840
Woody, you did all you could.

1370
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,675
Time to go home.

1371
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:53,927
No.

1372
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,011
Woody.

1373
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,471
I don't leave toys behind, Buzz.

1374
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:57,889
Yeah, but, Woody,
you're actually leaving...

1375
01:06:57,972 --> 01:06:59,807
Not now. Not ever.

1376
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:03,436
And he left me behind.

1377
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,022
What now, inner voice?

1378
01:07:06,189 --> 01:07:07,941
Mission
accomplished. Return to base.

1379
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,318
Go back to the RV?
What about Woody?

1380
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:12,195
We're going home, space ranger.

1381
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:13,571
Fall back, this planet...

1382
01:07:13,738 --> 01:07:14,781
Retreat! There's too...

1383
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:16,783
Go! Time to fly! Exit the...
Back... Run...

1384
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,618
Get out!
Returning to Star Command.

1385
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:21,037
Okay. Okay.

1386
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:24,499
Thanks a lot, inner voice.

1387
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:29,212
Harmony, honey, help Grandma
close up for the night.

1388
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:32,131
Okay. Then can we
go to the carnival?

1389
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,299
Sure.

1390
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,056
Hello, Woody.

1391
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:42,767
I knew you'd be back.

1392
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,478
You don't know me.

1393
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,188
But I do.

1394
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:50,775
You were left in the closet,
feeling useless...

1395
01:07:51,401 --> 01:07:53,403
wondering if you'll
ever get played with.

1396
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,363
I'm not leaving without Forky.

1397
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,574
Can we agree on just one thing?

1398
01:07:58,324 --> 01:07:59,492
What?

1399
01:07:59,576 --> 01:08:01,286
That being there for a child

1400
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:04,664
is the most noble thing
a toy can do.

1401
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:07,250
Okay.

1402
01:08:09,586 --> 01:08:13,131
I was defective
right out of the box.

1403
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:16,092
I can only imagine what it
must have been like for you.

1404
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,680
All that time you spent
with Andy...

1405
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:24,642
riding a bike with him
for the first time...

1406
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:28,479
comforting him
when he skinned his knee...

1407
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:30,898
proudly watching him grow up.

1408
01:08:32,317 --> 01:08:35,278
And then you got
a second chance with Bonnie...

1409
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:38,156
giving her comfort
when she's scared at school...

1410
01:08:38,323 --> 01:08:40,908
helping her
when she needs it most.

1411
01:08:41,993 --> 01:08:45,622
You've been there through
all their ups and downs.

1412
01:08:47,582 --> 01:08:49,083
Please.

1413
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,460
Be honest with me.

1414
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:55,131
Was it as wonderful
as it sounds?

1415
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:00,428
It was.

1416
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:08,019
All I want is a chance
for just one of those moments.

1417
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:14,233
I'd give anything to be loved
the way you have.

1418
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,699
Just leave me Forky.

1419
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,078
Bonnie needs him.

1420
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:28,331
Of course.

1421
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:42,220
The flat tire is fixed!

1422
01:09:42,387 --> 01:09:44,222
Come on, Woody, hurry up.

1423
01:09:44,389 --> 01:09:46,683
Where is he?

1424
01:09:46,766 --> 01:09:48,518
- Buzz!
- Buzz!

1425
01:09:48,685 --> 01:09:50,061
- Where's Woody?
- And Forky?

1426
01:09:50,144 --> 01:09:51,229
We have a situation.

1427
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,814
They need to be extracted
from the antique store.

1428
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:54,482
How do we do that?

1429
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:56,234
Okay, let's
make sure we have everything.

1430
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:57,985
Finally.

1431
01:09:58,152 --> 01:09:59,529
It's okay.
Any minute now...

1432
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:02,031
Bonnie will notice
her backpack is missing.

1433
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,991
She'll realize she left it
at the antique store...

1434
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:05,493
and we'll head back in there.

1435
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:07,495
Okay.
Looks like we have everything.

1436
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:09,080
- You good, Bonnie?
- Yup.

1437
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:10,373
Great. Let's get out of here.

1438
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,710
Okay, genius, what do we do now?

1439
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:15,878
Scanning perimeter.

1440
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:16,963
Laser at full power!

1441
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,173
- Buzz, what are you doing?
- I'm thinking.

1442
01:10:19,257 --> 01:10:20,967
Honey, will you
please shut that toy off?

1443
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:22,051
Yeah, I got it.

1444
01:10:22,135 --> 01:10:24,053
Attack!
Meteor shower! Look out!

1445
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:26,806
It's a secret mission in
uncharted space! Let's go!

1446
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:29,225
Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!

1447
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:30,518
Bonnie,
how do you turn this off?

1448
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:31,602
Full speed ahead!

1449
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,521
- Open the pod bay doors!
- I don't know.

1450
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:35,148
It's just you and me now, cadet.

1451
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:36,524
A distress signal is coming
from that rocket.

1452
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:37,817
Just toss it in the drawer.

1453
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:41,279
To infinity and beyond!

1454
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:43,573
Your backpack's in
the antique store! Let's go!

1455
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,116
No, my backpack!

1456
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,411
I left my backpack
in the antique store!

1457
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:49,829
You did?

1458
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:52,915
All right,
let's swing by and get it.

1459
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,798
I can't believe
the nerve of that cowboy.

1460
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:02,216
I mean, who does he think he is?

1461
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:03,593
Exactly!

1462
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,344
He was way out of line.

1463
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,180
You did the right thing
leaving him behind.

1464
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,099
Hey, Lamb Chops?

1465
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:11,893
Coast is clear.

1466
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:18,357
Head to the middle.

1467
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:19,942
When the carnival
leaves tomorrow,

1468
01:11:20,026 --> 01:11:21,277
we'll hide right there.

1469
01:11:23,404 --> 01:11:24,614
- No way!
- Stuff that.

1470
01:11:24,697 --> 01:11:25,698
Awesome.

1471
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:27,074
Stick with me.
You'll be fine.

1472
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,242
- Ready?
- No!

1473
01:11:28,326 --> 01:11:29,327
And another thing,

1474
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,912
- Woody asked you for help.
- On your mark...

1475
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,038
And he treats you like that?

1476
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,248
- ...get set...
- He only cares about himself.

1477
01:11:34,332 --> 01:11:35,333
No!

1478
01:11:35,416 --> 01:11:36,584
You're wrong.

1479
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:38,377
Woody's always trying to
do right by his kid.

1480
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:40,254
By putting everyone in danger.

1481
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:42,757
That kind of crazy
loyalty just...

1482
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,175
You gotta love him for it.

1483
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:46,093
Say what now?

1484
01:11:46,177 --> 01:11:47,637
Hey, hey, hey, Bo!
What's the plan?

1485
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,930
Fill me in here.

1486
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,270
Get in! We're going back.

1487
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:57,355
We just got here.

1488
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:59,273
You heard Bo!
We're going back!

1489
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,526
Move your plush! Let's ride!

1490
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:09,992
You're my favorite...

1491
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,094
You are my best friend.

1492
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,595
Let's play all day!

1493
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,305
Benson!
Did you hear that?

1494
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:32,723
Isn't that lovely?

1495
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:33,975
Time for tea.

1496
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,852
Thank you, Woody.
Thank you!

1497
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,603
All my dreams

1498
01:12:37,687 --> 01:12:38,855
are coming true because of you.

1499
01:12:38,938 --> 01:12:40,022
Thank you! Thank you!

1500
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:41,107
You're welcome.

1501
01:12:42,275 --> 01:12:44,318
It's time, Benson.

1502
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:47,613
Goodbye, Forky.
I'm going to miss our talks.

1503
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,157
Me, too.
Good luck, Gabby.

1504
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:52,118
Thank you, my little utensil.

1505
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:56,247
Bye, Gabby!
Goodbye, Benson!

1506
01:12:57,248 --> 01:12:59,333
He is terrifying.

1507
01:13:00,626 --> 01:13:01,961
- Hello.
- Hi.

1508
01:13:02,044 --> 01:13:03,212
Bonnie?

1509
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:04,463
Can I help you with anything?

1510
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:05,756
Yeah. We called
about the backpack.

1511
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,633
Yes.
I couldn't find it.

1512
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:09,427
Feel free to look around.

1513
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,762
Quick! Before she finds it!

1514
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:16,309
Look! There's Harmony.

1515
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,063
You make me so happy!

1516
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:22,273
Let's be best friends.

1517
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,650
This is it!

1518
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:26,569
We're going home, Forky!

1519
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:31,198
Forky!

1520
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:34,452
No, no, no. Woody, look!
It's really happening!

1521
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:43,294
I'm Gabby Gabby, and I love you.

1522
01:13:45,004 --> 01:13:46,672
I'm gonna cry.

1523
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:52,136
What have you got there?

1524
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,013
I found this old doll.

1525
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:57,141
You can take it home
if you want.

1526
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:00,019
Nah.

1527
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:10,196
What happened? Gabby was
supposed to be her toy.

1528
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:11,989
There's my backpack!

1529
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:13,157
Mom, it's over here.

1530
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:19,538
Forky!

1531
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:21,123
Mom, I found him!

1532
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,708
There he is!

1533
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:24,669
Now, please leave him in there,

1534
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:25,836
so he doesn't get lost again.

1535
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:34,637
But what about Gabby?

1536
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:37,932
Forky, listen to me
very carefully.

1537
01:14:38,099 --> 01:14:39,725
This is important.

1538
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:41,852
Tell Buzz to get the RV
to the merry-go-round.

1539
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:43,020
You understand?

1540
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:45,231
Absolutely.
What is a merry-go-round?

1541
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,942
The spinny ride
with lights and horses.

1542
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:49,360
- You mean a carousel.
- Yes!

1543
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,737
Carousel. Yes!
Meet me at the carousel.

1544
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:52,822
Got it.

1545
01:15:06,252 --> 01:15:08,629
Gabby! Hey, Gabby!

1546
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,590
You can have
your voice box back.

1547
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:15,136
I don't need it anymore.

1548
01:15:15,302 --> 01:15:16,345
Yes, you do.

1549
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,264
Harmony wasn't
your only chance, Gabby,

1550
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,557
but we have to hurry. Come on.

1551
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,893
No. Harmony was my chance.

1552
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:25,938
My time's over.

1553
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:27,982
Now, please go away.

1554
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:41,203
You hear that?

1555
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,670
A friend once told me...

1556
01:15:49,837 --> 01:15:52,256
"There are plenty of kids
out there."

1557
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:55,926
And one of them is named Bonnie.

1558
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,181
She's waiting for you,
right now.

1559
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:03,434
She just doesn't know it yet.

1560
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:08,314
What if you're wrong?

1561
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:12,026
Well, if you sit on a shelf
the rest of your life...

1562
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:14,070
you'll never find out, will you?

1563
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:19,033
He's right.

1564
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,744
I learned that from the best.

1565
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:28,167
Come on, Gabby.

1566
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,960
Let's get you to Bonnie.

1567
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:37,718
The carousel?

1568
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:40,387
Yeah, it's the spinny ride
with lights and horses.

1569
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,181
Woody said to meet him there.

1570
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:44,183
- You gotta be kidding!
- How do we do that?

1571
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,476
We could...

1572
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:46,852
We are not sending Dad to jail.

1573
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:48,062
You're no fun.

1574
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:50,815
Left turn in 0.5 miles.

1575
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:53,609
Wait a second. I have an idea.

1576
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:05,913
Skunk!

1577
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:06,997
Skunk!

1578
01:17:17,842 --> 01:17:19,969
Too many people.
Gonna need an alternate route.

1579
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:22,138
Will we make it
to the carousel in time?

1580
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,185
Yes, we Canada!

1581
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:29,520
What? What is it?

1582
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:38,988
Recalculating.
Take a right.

1583
01:17:39,071 --> 01:17:40,239
What? A right?

1584
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:42,116
Right turn ahead.

1585
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:44,034
Does the GPS sound funny to you?

1586
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:45,744
Honey, it's fine. Just drive.

1587
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,621
I thought it sounded funny.

1588
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:51,709
Another right!

1589
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:53,919
- Right.
- Take another right.

1590
01:17:54,003 --> 01:17:55,504
Another right? Really?

1591
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:56,714
- Turn right!
- Now!

1592
01:17:56,797 --> 01:17:58,174
Turn right!

1593
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:02,052
- We're headin' back.
- There's the carousel!

1594
01:18:02,136 --> 01:18:04,597
Do you think
Woody will get there in time?

1595
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,516
Nope. Forget it. Never.
No. No way. Declined.

1596
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:09,560
- No dice. Rejected.
- Duke, Duke, you got this.

1597
01:18:09,727 --> 01:18:11,395
This is the fastest way
to the carousel.

1598
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:12,688
You made the last jump.

1599
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:14,857
Yeah, but that was 4 feet.
This is 40!

1600
01:18:15,024 --> 01:18:18,277
Exactly! Duke Caboom
would never repeat a stunt.

1601
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:20,237
- No. He'd never do that.
- No, no, no.

1602
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:22,364
He's the toy
that went on to crash

1603
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:25,451
40 feet into that target!

1604
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:27,578
Yeah, he is.

1605
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:29,246
I'm Duke Caboom!

1606
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:31,123
Oh, man. I can do this!

1607
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:32,499
Yes, you Canada!

1608
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:33,834
I can do it with my eyes closed.

1609
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:34,919
Yes, you... What?

1610
01:18:35,002 --> 01:18:36,587
- Three, two, one. Go!
- What? No, wait!

1611
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:44,261
- What is he doing?
- No.

1612
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:57,233
This is for you, Rejean.

1613
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,031
Caboom.

1614
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:08,285
Yes!

1615
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:09,745
He did it!

1616
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:10,913
All right, our turn!

1617
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,998
You heard the sheriff.
Let's go.

1618
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:20,130
Yee-haw!

1619
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:24,260
Another right!

1620
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,053
Another right?
That's the wrong way.

1621
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,097
- Are you sure?
- Stupid rental.

1622
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29,723
- I'm turning us around.
- No!

1623
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:31,183
Recalculating.

1624
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:32,351
Turn right.

1625
01:19:32,518 --> 01:19:34,853
- Must be broken.
- No! No!

1626
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:40,359
What is happening?

1627
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,568
Honey, what are you doing?
Slow down!

1628
01:19:41,652 --> 01:19:42,653
I can't! I can't!

1629
01:19:43,279 --> 01:19:45,114
- Press the brake. Press it!
- I'm trying.

1630
01:19:51,912 --> 01:19:53,330
Got a visual on the RV,

1631
01:19:53,414 --> 01:19:55,457
heading southbound.

1632
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:01,797
Gabby?

1633
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:05,342
Gabby?

1634
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:10,723
I think she's lost.

1635
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,656
Are you sure?

1636
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:40,085
Change of plans.

1637
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:46,967
Pull over.

1638
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:49,470
I can't! This is a rental!

1639
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:51,013
I don't know what's happening!

1640
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,025
I'm so nervous.

1641
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,694
- What if she doesn't like me?
- Gabby.

1642
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:06,862
I don't know if I can do this.

1643
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:09,448
Gabby, it's just like you said.

1644
01:21:10,032 --> 01:21:12,951
This is the most noble thing
a toy can do.

1645
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:19,124
Okay.

1646
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:22,002
Just edge yourself
a bit into the light.

1647
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,465
Not too far.

1648
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:28,217
That's it.

1649
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:30,761
Perfect.

1650
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:34,014
- Winner, winner...
- Chicken dinner.

1651
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:58,372
Are you lost, too?

1652
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:04,461
I'm Gabby Gabby.
Will you be my friend?

1653
01:22:05,963 --> 01:22:07,548
I'll help you.

1654
01:22:14,513 --> 01:22:18,058
Excuse me, can you...
Can you help us?

1655
01:22:18,225 --> 01:22:19,601
Honey, what's wrong?

1656
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:21,478
I can't find my mom and dad.

1657
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:23,355
It's okay.
I'll help you find them.

1658
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:24,690
I'm sure they're not far.

1659
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:26,150
She was right next to us.

1660
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:27,693
She was right here!

1661
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,278
And I looked
away for one second.

1662
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:30,612
Mommy!

1663
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:39,913
I couldn't find you...

1664
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:41,290
and then I found this doll.

1665
01:22:41,457 --> 01:22:42,458
You did?

1666
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:43,917
Her name is Gabby Gabby.

1667
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:58,807
We actually did that.

1668
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:01,518
Yeah. Yes!

1669
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:03,395
That was amazing.

1670
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,439
We make a great team, guys.

1671
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:09,860
Pull over now!

1672
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:13,238
Almost there.

1673
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,200
- Stop!
- Stop!

1674
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:22,581
Are we home?

1675
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:28,754
Sir, will you please
step out of the vehicle?

1676
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:31,423
Dad's totally going to jail.

1677
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,389
Everyone, topside.
Let's move.

1678
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:42,142
Forky, I've got a very
important job for you.

1679
01:23:42,476 --> 01:23:43,977
For me?

1680
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:46,230
Have a good night.

1681
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:49,691
What the...?

1682
01:23:50,817 --> 01:23:52,778
You've gotta be kidding me.

1683
01:24:07,417 --> 01:24:08,418
Hey.

1684
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,172
So long, cowboy.

1685
01:24:12,339 --> 01:24:13,674
Happy trails.

1686
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:22,766
Billy, Goat, Gruff.
Take care of her, girls.

1687
01:24:29,523 --> 01:24:31,817
I'm glad I got to see you again.

1688
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:35,028
I... I don't...

1689
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:03,140
Goodbye, Bo.

1690
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,042
Buzz, I... I...

1691
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:33,587
She'll be okay.

1692
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:39,384
Bonnie will be okay.

1693
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:46,933
You sure?

1694
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:49,686
Hey.
Listen to your inner voice.

1695
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:21,134
Bo?

1696
01:26:21,301 --> 01:26:22,302
Is it really her?

1697
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:23,804
I'll be danged, it's Bo!

1698
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:25,597
Jessie.

1699
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:27,265
Bo!

1700
01:27:28,952 --> 01:27:30,370
So long, Forky.

1701
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:35,041
Forky?
Who's watching the doors?

1702
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:38,295
- Go, go, go!
- Oh, boy.

1703
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:41,923
Oh, my goodness. The awning.
What is going on?

1704
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:19,377
Does this mean
Woody's a lost toy?

1705
01:28:19,544 --> 01:28:20,670
He's not lost.

1706
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:23,924
Not anymore.

1707
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:27,093
To infinity...

1708
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:30,013
And beyond.

1709
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:31,074
There goes another one.

1710
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:32,868
We're never getting outta here.

1711
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,160
Frog legs.

1712
01:29:34,244 --> 01:29:35,370
Up here, Rainbow Connection.

1713
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:38,039
You Mr. Toads wanna take
a wild ride with a kid?

1714
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:39,124
We can make that happen.

1715
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:40,667
- You can?
- Really?

1716
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:42,252
Yeah!
Leave it to us, Jeremiah.

1717
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,088
All right. Nice job, gang!

1718
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:28,590
Every prize with a kid.

1719
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:30,133
- What's next?
- Leave that to us.

1720
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,093
We know exactly what to do.

1721
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:11,633
Plush Rush!

1722
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:13,301
How you like that?

1723
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:15,220
You got plush-rushed, son!

1724
01:31:15,387 --> 01:31:16,596
Dance!

1725
01:31:17,931 --> 01:31:19,391
Dance! Get those knees up!

1726
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:24,229
Let's see those feet move!

1727
01:31:35,573 --> 01:31:37,909
Or we can get more toys to kids.

1728
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:39,744
Yeah, let's do that.

1729
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:44,082
Do you really have laser eyes?

1730
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:47,085
Yeah.

1731
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,158
Hi, toys. Bye, toys.

1732
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:20,285
Jessie's back!

1733
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:22,287
What's first grade like?
Tell me everything!

1734
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:23,455
Well, it was...

1735
01:32:23,538 --> 01:32:24,539
How was "Present and Explain"?

1736
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:26,249
You mean "Show and Tell"
there, big guy.

1737
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:27,584
You see any kids eat paste?

1738
01:32:27,667 --> 01:32:28,668
Guys, listen!

1739
01:32:28,752 --> 01:32:31,254
Bonnie had a great day
in first grade.

1740
01:32:31,421 --> 01:32:33,631
She even made
a new friend in class.

1741
01:32:33,715 --> 01:32:35,967
She's already making friends.

1742
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:38,762
No, no, she made a new friend.

1743
01:32:39,137 --> 01:32:41,639
Come on out, it's okay.

1744
01:33:00,033 --> 01:33:03,411
Hi. I'm... I'm Forky.

1745
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:05,580
Trash?

1746
01:33:05,747 --> 01:33:08,708
No, no. Toy.
I am a...

1747
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:10,919
We are all toys.

1748
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:14,881
Unique, beautiful toys.

1749
01:33:15,548 --> 01:33:18,843
I will explain everything.

1750
01:33:19,636 --> 01:33:23,681
How am I alive?

1751
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:28,228
I don't know.

1752
01:33:43,535 --> 01:33:47,789
I was a lonesome cowboy

1753
01:33:49,082 --> 01:33:52,210
Lonesome as I could be

1754
01:33:53,086 --> 01:33:57,048
You came along
and changed my life

1755
01:33:57,590 --> 01:34:00,677
And fixed what was broken in me

1756
01:34:02,137 --> 01:34:06,975
I was a lonesome cowboy

1757
01:34:08,393 --> 01:34:10,436
I didn't have a friend

1758
01:34:11,646 --> 01:34:15,692
Now I got friends
coming out of my ears

1759
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:19,529
I'll never be lonesome again

1760
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:24,951
You can't be happy
when you're all by yourself

1761
01:34:25,118 --> 01:34:27,370
Go on, tell me I'm wrong

1762
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:28,913
You're wrong

1763
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:33,251
When someone takes you
down from the shelf

1764
01:34:33,418 --> 01:34:36,713
And plays with you some
It's wonderful

1765
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:38,131
Wonderful

1766
01:34:38,298 --> 01:34:42,760
I was a lonesome cowboy

1767
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:46,681
But not anymore

1768
01:34:47,849 --> 01:34:51,853
I just found out
What love is about

1769
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:55,273
I've never felt this way before

1770
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:59,986
I was a lonesome cowboy

1771
01:35:02,071 --> 01:35:06,701
But not anymore

1772
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:56,824
Caboom!

1773
01:39:58,326 --> 01:39:59,327
Yes!
